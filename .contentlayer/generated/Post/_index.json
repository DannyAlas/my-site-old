      "raw": "\n# Eris: The Lab\n\n<center>\n  ![xkcd file transfer](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/file_transfer.png)\n</center>\nNamed after the greek god of chaos for what will become self-explanatory reasons,\nEris is the Lab in its totality. Ideally, one day, if there is a service I need to\nrun, I can call Eris, like Tony Stark calls \"Jarvis\" to do it for me. I just think\nit would be so cool to be to say, \"Hey Eris, deploy this discord bot for me,\" and\nfive minutes later, I have a discord bot, though we're a long way off from that.\nAlso note I have a habit of naming most applications by the name of mythological,\nusually greek gods - much to the behest of Richard - Deal with it Richard!\n\nEris currently consists of everything I have running on both physical and cloud infrastructure. Here's a breakdown of the main categories, which we can delve deeper into later.\n\n- Gaming Servers: Hades\n- Media Server: Apollo\n- Deployment Environments: Artemis\n- Utilities: Hephaestus\n- Management Infrastructure: Hera\\\n\nEach of these services is constantly being tweaked as new projects can often require functionality I still need to add. Thus I've opted not to create super fleshed-out services but instead base the entire Lab around development principles that are easily mutable.\n\nThe services are also as infrastructure agnostic as possible, leaving it up to me currently, but hopefully, Hera will decide how to deploy each service best in the future. For example, the media servers consist of cloud-based 'totally legal' seedboxes, physical media storage servers, and physical Jellyfin and Nextcloud servers to host the media. Each of these should ideally be managed by Hera to scale and provide as needed.\n\n## Networking\n\nBefore we delve into the physical hardware and then services, it's important to get an overview of the network. I have a few different subnets, each with their own purpose. The three main subnets are all we'll focus on here. The first is the internal subnet, which is used for all internal services such as GitLab and smart-home devices. The second is the external subnet, which is used for all public-facing services, like Plex and NextCloud. The third is the management subnet, which is used for all management services, like the DHCP server, Nginx proxy, and email server.\n\nMy physical network is pretty simple and composed of a single 15-port Cisco switch, which is connected to my router. The router is currently a store-bought router flashed with OpenWRT, but I'm planning on moving to OPNsense soon as I like the UI/UX more. I have a few VLANs set up on the switch, which is used to separate the different subnets. The switch is also connected to a few I.O.T. devices, like my Raspberry Pi and Pico, which are used for various projects. The Pico actually runs PiHole, which acts as my local DNS and is used to block ads on my network and among other things, the Pi 4 runs my DHCP server.\n\n## Physical Servers\n\nWith that all said, let's get to the bare bones of what actually runs everything. I have two physical servers, both composed of old desktops I no longer use. I also have a Raspberry Pi 4 and Pico, alongside a few other I.O.T. devices. Both of my main servers are running ProxMox, which is a virtualization platform that allows me to run multiple VMs on a single physical server.\n\n### Server 1: Zeus\n\n_THE FATHER OF ALL_\n\n> Specs: Intel i7-6700k, 16GB DDR4, 1x 2TB SSD, 3x 2TB HDD, 2x 1TB HDD\n\nZeus is my main server, and it runs Proxmox and is where I host most of my services. Zeus is the first server I ever built, and it's been through a lot. He's spent much time with no case, He's had an AIO leak that broke a motherboard and CPU and two freak random RAM-breaking incidents. He's getting old... but still kicking on strong as ever.\n\nI have quite a few VM's running on Zeus, but the main ones are\n\n- The Storage server | TrueNas Scale\n- The Jellyfin server | Ubuntu 22.04\n- The Nextcloud server | Ubuntu 20.04\n- The Plex server | Ubuntu 22.04\n\n### Server 2: Poseidon\n\n_THE GOD OF THE SEA_\n\n> Specs: AMD FX 6300, 8GB DDR3, 250GB SSD, 2x 1TB HDD\n\nPoseidon is my backup server. Hosting my backup VMs and mirrors, as well as some utilities like an email server and NGINX proxy.\n\n### Hades: The Gaming Servers\n\n_THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD, and mischief..._\n\nAs an avid game player, it's nice to be the one to provide a place where friends can all game together without the worry of cost, complexity, or administration. This all comes down to Hades to provide from the underworld...\n\nHades is currently one large python script run in a docker container that can create Minecraft, Rust, Valheim, and other game servers. Though most servers are more often created by hand, the Minecraft server was what started this whole shebang, and It's pretty automated at this point. Here's an overview of how it works.\n\nThe majority of Hades' code is actually dedicated to gaming the cloud 'new-account-credit' system. He's a bit mischievous, you see, most cloud providers offer a free credit, often $200, to new accounts created on the platform. This is meant to attract new users, but as a college student, I see free game servers. While I won't talk too much about the specifics, it simply does four things:\n\n- Creates new user emails, contact info, and crucially credit card information\n- Using Selenium, signs up as a new user to one of the cloud providers with free credit available\n- In the browser, creates and provisions the server, saving the ssh keys\n- Using the key, deploys a custom Minecraft server in docker with ITZG's docker-minecraft-server and transfer files over sftp.\n\n> NOTE: Using a browser to automate provisioning was a BIG mistake and cuased MANY of headaches\n>\n> “Short cuts make long delays.” ― J.R.R. Tolkien\n\n## Management\n\nThis is mostly handled by Hera, but I'll go over the basics.\n\nOnce the server is up, it must undergo some basic management, my local key management database can automatically find the required credentials to ssh into a server whenever needed manually, but I have also created some scripts to automate parts of this for me. For example, almost every Minecraft server I have uses a base set of plugins. I have the configs for these saved in Hades' plugin database, which now automatically uploads the best config for the installed plugins to simplify the startup management.\n\nTo manage the domains and server IPs, I host all my domains on Cloudflare. Hera can detect when a new server is made by Hades and use the Cloudflare API to update the DNS records for the required domains as needed.\n\nWhile not the prettiest of solutions, Hades can now almost automatically deploy a free Minecraft server in minutes. I've recently been adding a feature to move the server to a new account once the 'free credits' are up, as longer-running servers are currently moved manually. Rust and Valheim servers are started less frequently and thus really only take advantage of Hades' free server provisioning features; the startup and management are much more manual.\n\n### Apollo: The Media Server\n\n_THE SON OF ZEUS AND LEADER OF THE MUSES_\n\n<center>\n  ![xkcd sony microsoft mpaa riaa\n  apple](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sony_microsoft_mpaa_riaa_apple.jpg)\n</center>\nApollo is, at its core, a Jellyfin server, but it also hosts a Nextcloud instance,\na Plex server, and a few other services. It was one of the first things I virtualized\non Zeus, hence the name, and it's one of a few public-facing services. It hosts all\nthe media I have for my family and friends to access as well as a cloud storage solution\nfor them to use.\n\nI use both Jellyfin and Plex since, while I prefer the simplicity of Jellyfin, It doesn't have good app support, especially for TVs. Plex is not my favorite, but it has much better app support, so my family members can use it to stream to their TVs and phones. Running both is not very compute-intensive, and it's a good enough solution for now.\n\nThe Jellyfin server is the main media server, and it's hosted as a VM on my physical machine: Zeus. It's a pretty standard setup. The media is stored on my personal storage server, which is also a VM on Zeus. The storage server is a simple TrueNas Scale server which the Jellyfin server is also backed up to with rsync. Plex is basically the same setup.\n\nThe Nextcloud server is also hosted on the same machine as the Jellyfin server, and it's used to provide a cloud storage solution for my family and friends. It's also used to host a few other services, like a password manager.\n\nThe Seedbox is a cloud-based service that I use to download media from the internet. It's a pretty standard setup, and it's hosted on a cloud provider with free credit. I happened to get lucky with the cloud provider giving me a year of free service, but after that, I'll probably move to a self-hosted seedbox.\n\n### Artemis: The Deployment Environment\n\n_THE GODDESS OF BIRTHING_\n\nArtemis gives life to my code. She is a collection of tools I use to deploy my applications. I host my own GitLab instance here, which is used to host my personal projects and to host my own GitLab CI/CD pipelines. It's hosted on a VM on my physical machine: Zeus, with backups to my storage server. I also host some non-GitLab CD pipelines, which are a collection of bash scripts and Ansible playbooks that are run whenever I push to a specific repository. These pipelines are used to deploy my applications to my physical servers.\n\nSome of the applications I host are:\n\n- Personal website\n- Discord bots\n- Web scraping scripts\n- Small Minecraft server\n- Email server\n- A few other small projects\n\n### Hephaestus: The Utility Server\n\n_THE GOD OF FIRE, METALWORKING, AND TECHNOLOGY_\n\nHephaestus is a utility service that I use to manage a few small services. It's hosted on a VM on my physical machine: Zeus, with backups to my storage server. It manages a few utilities like my DHCP server, DNS server, email server, and a few other small services. One of its important hosts is Hestia, which I use to manage my ssh keys.\n\n### Hestia: The Key Management Database\n\n_THE GODDESS OF HEARTH_\n\nHestia is a simple database that I use to manage my ssh keys. It's hosted on a VM on my physical machine: Zeus, with backups to my storage server. It's a simple Flask app that uses a SQLite database to store the ssh keys for my servers. It's used by Hera to get the ssh keys for a server whenever needed and can upload them to an ssh-agent. It's also used by my compute swarm to get the ssh keys for the VMs in the swarm.\n\n### Hera: The Management Infrastructure\n\n_THE GODDESS OF THE HOME_\n\nHera is the newest and least stable part of my infrastructure. It's a collection of Ansible playbooks that I use to manage my infrastructure. It's still in development, but her main purpose is to simplify the management of my infrastructure. She’s also, as mentioned before, meant to be infrastructure agnostic, so I can deploy it to any server, and it will work. She’s currently hosted as a Debian VM on my physical machine: Zeus, with backups to my storage server.\n\nHer core functionality is to manage my physical servers, and is currently able to do the following:\n\n- Install and configure basic NGINX, NodeJS, and Docker setups for a server\n- Obtain the ssh keys for a server from the Key Management Database\n- Simple server management like starting, stopping, and restarting servers\n- very basic command line interface to manage the servers\n",

In the second part, Hume shifts his focus from the abstract to the concrete and argues that, in actuality, no miracles that serve as the foundation for religious systems possess adequate evidence to meet the epistemological criteria laid out in Part I. To assess Hume's success in making a case against miracles, we must primarily consider Part I, the epistemology of miracles. In my view, Hume has convincingly made the argument against miracles while also not ruling out their potentiality, as is expected of a rational thinker.\n\nHume defines miracles as\n\n> “a violation of the laws of nature\" where the laws of nature are established from “firm and unalterable experience[s]” (Cahn, 127, Hume). He appears to believe that these “firm and unalterable experience[s]”\n> are established from one’s uniform experiences, that is a consistent set of experiences where nothing has been incorrectly predicted by previous experiences throughout life. Thus since Hume regards that “uniform experience amounts to proof,” we have a full proof for the laws of nature.\n\nThough what does Hume mean by proof? It is important here to explore this as what Hume is referring to as a proof is foundational to the success of his arguments and credibility as a rational actor. Yet given such importance, one would be amiss to find an equally clear definition in his text. However, Hume does distinguish between probability and proof. He defines proofs to be founded on “infallible experience” with which one can expect, with the “last degree of assurance” that their past experiences would constitute a predicted future event and probability to be founded on one’s best judgment of the available evidence. (Hume, 116)\n\nIn Earmans’ “_Hume's Abject Failure: The Argument Against Miracles_,” Earman believes that when Hume refers to proof as being an “infallible experience,” he’s regarding an unfalsifiable metaphysical claim, or in other words, a claim that can not be altered via any evidence. If this were the case, it would make Hume irrational as there would be no evidence that could convince one with such a conviction that they are incorrect. Or as Earman puts it, “[for Hume,] the probability of a miracle is [always] flatly zero. Very simple. And very crude.” (Earman, 23) This could be seen better with Bayesian inferencing, where the probability that a miracle occurred given the evidence is extrapolated as such.\n\nIn the case that Hume regarded probability that a miracle occurred to be 0, metaphysically impossible, no evidence could ever change the outcome, the belief. It would always be 0. And the same goes for if is 1, the probability of a miracle occurring is always true and thus, the outcome is also always 1, regardless of any and all evidence to the contrary.\n\n` `If we take Hume at this level of analysis, his metaphysical argument would boil down to “There must, therefore, be a uniform experience against every miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit that appellation. And as an uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full proof, from the nature of the fact, against the existence of any miracle[…]”(Cahn, 128, Hume). Essentially stating that since for there to be a miracle, there must definitionally be a uniform experience that amounts to proof against it, and since proofs are binary, miracles always have a probability of 0 and, thus, are never true. No evidence can convince him otherwise. Hume is irrational! But if we merit a better faith analysis, this would not be Hume's argument. He continues the previous statement with “nor can such a proof be destroyed, or the miracle rendered credible, but by an opposite proof, which is superior” (Cahn, 128, Hume). Thus Hume does not believe proofs against a miracle are conferred a binary probability. They can be “rendered credible” by another, better proof. Hume is rational! To disregard this point is to misinterpret Hume altogether, as I believe Earman has done.\n\nWith this in mind, we can venture into how Hume presumes one should analyze and compare competing proofs. In Part I, earlier than what is established by Cahn, Hume, an empiricist, explains how one may assume reasoning for such comparisons. Initially, he begins by stating the inherent fallibility of experiential reasoning, “Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us to errors.” In context with the earlier part of this text, It should be evident now that Hume certainly understands the proofs for the laws of nature are not infallible. He continues the above passage with the analogy, “One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken.” Thus even when the strongest experiential evidence, uniform experiences (a proof), ties a connection that has correctly predicted all events, Hume understands and argues here that there is no guarantee. P(M) and P(R) can never be 1 or 0.\n\nIt is still not clear when Hume compares proofs how he differentiates between that of one's own experiences and that of others. Though It appears most consistent with his arguments that when comparing, the experiences relevant to Hume are not limited to any singular experiential agent but must be that of all experiential agents. There are two primary reasons for this line of reasoning. First, it addresses the issues that arise when reasoning from one's own experience alone, specifically the significant limitation on the matters of fact that one can reason about. For instance, one cannot simply conclude, based on the regularity of their own experience, that a dead man never rises again because nobody has had enough personal experience of death. The second reason for appealing to collective experience arises in cases where an agent reasons, from their uniform experiences, of a consistent correlation of events, that another agent who has also had uniform experiences reasons a consistent uncorrelation of.\n\nHume's case of the Indian Prince appears to provide the best example of this form of reasoning from collective experience. Upon being informed of the effects frost has on water, freezing it, the Prince reasons from their uniform experience that water is always liquid under all circumstances to the conclusion that the informant must be lying. While the Prince is using reasoning, they arrive at an incorrect conclusion. As Hume points out, such an event [water freezing] may be considered extraordinary and require strong testimony to render it credible to people in a warm climate. However, this event is not miraculous nor contrary to uniform experiences in colder climates where all circumstances are the same. (Hume, 119) This highlights that Hume believes in the importance of considering the experiences of those in different circumstances when evaluating between claims.\n\nLastly, to assert that Hume rationally addresses all claims for miracles, we must discuss how Hume approaches the testimony of miracles. In Part I, he makes the following famous maxim:\n\n“[N]o testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish; and even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior.” (Cahn, 127, Hume)\n\nIn which for the testimony of a miracle to be credible Hume is essentially stating that the proof for it must be greater than the proof against it. Then in as so far as the “falsehood [of the testimony] would [have to] be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish,” if the proof for the miracle is already superior to that against it, this would be definitionally true. Essentially testimony is required to be about as perfect as can be to rival the proofs of natural law. A testimony of such stature, Hume asserts, can not be proved “so as to be the foundation of a system of religion” (Cahn, 129, Hume) but does not state that miracles are a priori impossible. When the two rival, we have proof against proof, and Hume states, \"[When] there is proof against proof, [..] the strongest must prevail, but still with a diminution of its force, in proportion to that of its antagonist.” (Cahn, 127, Hume)\n\nHume proceeds with a pragmatic example of someone witnessing the resurrection of a dead man. He evaluates the testimonial proof of the miracle against the experiential proof of the possibility of the witness being deceived and concludes that the greater miracle should be rejected. As we have seen with Hume's observations on the fallibility of our experiences, in most cases, the greater proof will be the fallibility of our experiences rather than the violation of natural law. In other words, the occurrence that does not align with our uniform experience is most often the greater miracle. Thus, Hume has effectively argued for the extreme improbability of a miracle testimony ever being true, but as a rational thinker, has not ruled out the possibility of a miracle ever occurring and its testimony being true.\n\nIn his work \"On Miracles,\" Paul Dietl raises an important challenge to Hume's proclivity against the credibility of miracles. Dietl notes that some events which meet the criteria for being considered a miracle may be inherently beyond our ability to analyze or experimentally reproduce. Specifically, Dietl argues that certain miracles may lack an independent variable, making them difficult to understand with scientific analysis. Dietl gives the example of a prophet tasked with performing a miracle under highly controlled conditions where no variable can be “pinned down as the independent variable in scientific explanation.” (Cahn, 132) If the prophet succeeds in accomplishing the miracle, we would be dealing solely with “requests and answers, that is, thoughts, and thoughts not as psychological occurrences but as understood [only from the prophet to a God]. No natural law will do because only vehicles of thought could function as the natural explanans, and no such vehicle is necessary.”\n\nFor Dietl's conclusion to hold, he would have to demonstrate that all future scientific inquiries would be categorically unable to provide any natural explanation for the observed phenomenon, not just our current understanding. This is a significant claim and one that Dietl has not successfully justified, as he provides no explanation for how we could rule out all future inquiries. If we encounter a miracle that defies our current scientific understanding and lacks any independent variable to pinpoint, we may still employ Hume's tools to compare the miracles. We could ask ourselves whether it is more miraculous that a God has broken some natural law or simply that we lack the tools of inquiry to analyze the situation.\n\nIn essence, Hume's conceptualization of miracles hinges upon the idea of a deviation from the laws of nature as they are established through firm and unalterable experience. Through this framework, he effectively differentiates between probability and proof, the latter of which he defines as being grounded in firm and unalterable experiences that can still be disproven. When the evidential proof for a miracle ever rivals that of natural law, then they must be subjected to a comparative analysis, and the one with greater justification ought to be embraced. However, Hume remains cognizant of the fact that experiences are fallible and that testimony, if of adequate stature, can contest natural laws as proof. In sum, while Hume's perspective successfully discredits the arguments against miracles, his position as a rational thinker precludes him from outrightly disproving their possibility.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nCahn, Steven M. _Exploring Philosophy of Religion: An Introductory Anthology_.
