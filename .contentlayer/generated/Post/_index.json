It's my dream that one day I can just call out to \"Eris\" like Tony Stark calls out to \"Jarvis,\" and it will deploy any service I need. I have a habit of naming most applications after mythological Greek gods, much to the chagrin of [Richard](https://www.yerich.net/blog/please-dont-name-your-services-after-greek-gods). But hey, deal with it Richard!\n\nEris is a hot mess of both physical and cloud infrastructure, consisting of everything I have running. Below is a breakdown of the main categories, but each service is constantly evolving as new projects require new functionality. I've opted not to create super fleshed-out services but instead base the entire lab around development principles that are easily mutable. The services are also as infrastructure agnostic as possible, leaving it up to me currently, but hopefully Hera in the future, to deploy each service on the best infrastructure.\n\n- Gaming Servers: Hades\n- Media Server: Apollo\n- Deployment Environments: Artemis\n- Utilities: Hephaestus\n- Management Infrastructure: Hera\n\n## Networking\n\n<br/>\n\n<center>\n  ![xkcd file transfer](https://i.danielalas.com/b3f392c3)\n</center>\nBefore we get down to the nitty-gritty of the hardware and services, let's take a moment to admire the network setup. It's a beautiful symphony of packets gracefully smacking into network chips at the speed of light. \n\nThe router is my good friend, the [Protectli Vault FW4B](https://amzn.to/3AQ6JUV), running PfSense. It was a bit pricey, but this guy is a tiny powerhouse! It's small, quiet, and powerful enough to run all the traffic I throw at it with ease. \n\nThen there's the access point, my old [Netgear r6700](https://amzn.to/41PB95I). We had what some would call “irreconcilable differences” about his firmware that we just couldn't resolve. I tried to install OpenWrt, but after more flashes than I care to admit and a broken serial connector, he’s now just my AP. Serving as a constant reminder of our troubled past, it's simmilar to a divorced couple that still has to live together for the kids...  \n\n> It may soon be time to start seeing other APs. I've got my eye on the Unifi 6 Lite, It's the rebound relationship I need I’m in need of. And who knows, maybe it'll even be the one to finally heal my broken heart and give me that stable, reliable wireless network I've always dreamed of.\n> \n\nThe main switch is the [TP-Link SG108E](https://amzn.to/40TxNxk). It's a simple 8-port managed switch that runs 2 VLANs — one for the wireless network that guests connect to and one for the internal services. If my AP was \"VLAN aware,\" I’d love to have separate SSIDs for guest and internal wireless networks, but it's not, and so for now, my wireless network is segregated to the public VLAN. \n\nAnd finally, the trusty [Linksys LGS105](https://amzn.to/41ZYwcT). He’s really only used if I’m having a LAN party, which I’d really love to do more.\n\n## Physical Servers\n\nLet's get to the juicy bones of what's really making this lab tick. I've got the two old/previous desktops that I've Frankenstein-ed into physical servers, along with a Raspberry Pi 4, a Pico, and some other janky I.O.T. devices. It's a hot mess, but it works. And to keep things even more interesting, both of my main servers are running ProxMox (in a cluser), which lets me run multiple virtual machines on each physical server. It's virtualization inception, but instead of a dream within a dream, it's a VM within a VM within a VM... you get the idea.\n\n### Server 1: Zeus\n\n<br/>\n\n<center>\n  ![xkcd file transfer](https://i.danielalas.com/44371b52)\n</center>\n\n*THE FATHER OF ALL*\n\n- [Intel i7-6700k](https://amzn.to/42bPol8)\n- [32GB DDR4](https://amzn.to/3LpVSpD)\n- 4x [Seagate BarraCuda 4Tb](https://amzn.to/41SfKsP) Drive (Raid z1)\n- 2x 2Tb random Drives (Raid z1)\n- 1 [PNY 250Gb SSD](https://amzn.to/3nfbhBp) (OS)\n\nZeus is the granddaddy of all my servers. He's been through more disasters than a Greek tragedy: no case, AIO leaks, RAM-breaking incidents, you name it. But like a fine wine, he only gets better with age.\n\nZeus is where most of the action happens, with a plethora of virtual machines running amok. The main players include:\n\n- The Storage Server | TrueNas Scale\n- The Media Server | Debian w/ Portainer (QBt, the *arr’s, etc)\n- The Nextcloud server | Ubuntu 20.04\n- The Plex server | Ubuntu 22.04\n\n### Server 2: Poseidon\n\n<br/>\n\n<center>\n  ![xkcd file transfer](https://i.danielalas.com/205430d8)\n  <em>\n  We don't talk about this state...\n  </em>\n</center>\n\n*THE GOD OF THE SEA*\n\n> Specs: AMD FX 6300, 8GB DDR3, 250GB SSD, 2x 1TB HDD\n\nPoseidon may be the God of the Sea but also doubles as the backup server for the Lab. He hosts backup VMs and mirrors, along with some utilities like an email server and NGINX proxy - you know, just in case the sea gets a little choppy.\n\n## Hades: The Gaming Servers\n\n*THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD, and mischief...*\n\nHades is the ultimate wingman for your gaming needs. He's that one friend who always knows where the party's at and can get you in without breaking a sweat. Cost, deployment, and management are all taken care of by Hades right from the UNDERWORLD... I mean, the cloud.\n\nHades is currently a couple of inordinately large python scripts run in a docker container that can create Minecraft, Rust, Valheim game servers. Though most servers are often created by hand, the Minecraft server was what started this whole shebang, and It's pretty automated at this point. Here's an overview of how it works.\n\nThe majority of Hades' code is actually dedicated to gaming the cloud 'new-account-credit' system. He's a bit of a trickster, you see, most cloud providers offer a free credit, often $200, to new accounts created on the platform. This is meant to attract new users, but as a college student, I see free game servers. While I won't talk too much about the specifics, it simply does four things:\n\n- Creates new user emails, contact info, and **crucially** credit card information thanks to [privacy.com](https://privacy.com/)\n- Using Selenium, signs up as a new user to one of the cloud providers with free credit available\n- In the browser, creates and provisions the server, saving the ssh keys\n- Using the key, deploys a custom Minecraft server in docker with [ITZG's docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) and transfer files over sftp.\n\n> NOTE: Using a browser to automate provisioning was a BIG mistake and caused MANY headaches\n> \n> \n> “Short cuts make long delays.” ― J.R.R. Tolkien\n> \n\n## Management\n\nThis is mostly handled by Hera, but I'll go over the basics.\n\nShe is in charge of managing everything, but she's also the newest and least stable part of the gang. To give her some credit, she can automate some basic management tasks, like finding the right credentials to SSH into a server. And for those Minecraft servers, I've saved the configs for the base set of plugins in Hera’s plugin database, so now she can automatically provide Hades the best config for the installed plugins.\n\nTo manage the domains and server IPs, I host all my domains on Cloudflare. Hera can detect when a new server is made by Hades and use the Cloudflare API to update the DNS records for the required domains as needed.\n\nWhile not the prettiest of solutions, Hades can now almost automatically deploy a free Minecraft server in minutes. I've recently been adding a feature to move the server to a new account once the 'free credits' are up, as longer-running servers are currently moved manually. Rust and Valheim servers are started less frequently and thus really only take advantage of Hades' free server provisioning features; the startup and management are much more manual.\n\n### Apollo: The Media Server\n\n*THE SON OF ZEUS AND LEADER OF THE MUSES*\n\n<br/>\n\n<center>\n![sony microsoft mpaa riaa apple suck](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sony_microsoft_mpaa_riaa_apple.jpg)\n</center>\n\nApollo is like a one-stop shop for all my family and friends' media needs. It was one of the first things I virtualized on Zeus, hence the name, and it's one of a few public-facing services. It hosts all\nthe media I have for my family and friends to access, as well as a cloud storage solution\nfor them to use because why trust big corp with your data when you can host it on my unencrypted, residential, 2015 mid-tier consumer hardware-based data center?\n\nI use both Jellyfin and Plex since, while I prefer the simplicity of Jellyfin (and also the ability to modify playback speed, WHY DOESN’T PLEX SUPPORT THIS YET, it’s been a decade), It doesn't have good app support, especially for TVs. Plex is not my favorite, but it has much better app support, so my family members can use it to stream to their TVs and phones. Running both is not very compute-intensive, and it's a good enough solution for now. The Plex server is hosted as a VM on Zeus as a pretty standard setup with the media being stored in a TrueNas SMB share. The backups are light for now, with only crucial media being backed up off-site.\n\nThe Nextcloud server is also hosted on Zues, though I’m working on moving to a custom solution with a Ceph cluster.\n\nApollo is also no landlubber — he frequents the high seas with ease, thanks to his mighty crew. Among his crew, he counts quartermaster Portainer, qBittorrent, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowler, Jacket, and flare resolver, all of whom are ready to plunder the vast seas of the internet for treasure. But this pirate's adventure never ends, and he's even considering some Usenet dabbling. Apollo is not just a fearless pirate he's also a smart one. He knows the importance of protecting his treasure from prying eyes and has enlisted the help of his trusty crewmate PfSense, with Wiregaurd tunnels in PfSense, prying eyes kept shut.\n\n### Artemis: The Deployment Environment\n\n*THE GODDESS OF BIRTHING*\n\nArtemis gives life to my code. She is a collection of tools I use to deploy my applications. I host my own GitLab instance here, which is used to host personal projects and to host some CI/CD pipelines. She's hosted on Zeus and backed and is part of the crucial backup media. I also host some non-GitLab CD pipelines, a motley crew of bash scripts and Ansible playbooks that are triggered by various hooks. These pipelines are used to deploy my applications to my physical servers and watching them execute is like watching a baby bird take its first flight, but with less feathers and more... ```Typescript Error: Type 'yourMoms' is not assignable to type  UnpackNestedTrauma<aHoe<T>>```.\n\nSome of the applications I host are:\n\n- Personal website\n- Discord bots\n- Web scraping scripts\n- Small Minecraft server\n- Email server\n- A few other small projects\n\n### Hephaestus: The Utility Server\n\n*THE GOD OF FIRE, METALWORKING, AND TECHNOLOGY*\n\nHephaestus is a utility service that I use to manage a few smaller applications. It's hosted on a VM on my physical machine: Zeus, with backups to my storage server. It manages a few utilities like my DHCP server, DNS server, email server, and a few other small services. One of its important hosts is Hestia, which I use to manage my ssh keys.\n\n### Hestia: The Key Management Database\n\n*THE GODDESS OF HEARTH*\n\nHestia is a simple database that I use to manage my ssh keys. It's hosted on a VM on my physical machine: Zeus, with backups to my storage server. It's a simple Flask app that uses a SQLite database to store the ssh keys for my servers. It's used by Hera to get the ssh keys for a server whenever needed and can upload them to an ssh-agent. It's also used by my compute swarm to get the ssh keys for the VMs in the swarm.\n\n### Hera: The Management Infrastructure\n\n*THE GODDESS OF THE HOME*\n\nHera is the newest and least stable part of my infrastructure. It's a collection of Ansible playbooks that I use to manage my infrastructure. It's still in development, but her main purpose is to simplify the management of my infrastructure. She’s also, as mentioned before, meant to be infrastructure agnostic, so I can deploy it to any server, and it will work. She’s currently hosted as a Debian VM on my physical machine: Zeus, with backups to my storage server.\n\nHer core functionality is to manage my physical servers, and is currently able to do the following:\n\n- Install and configure basic NGINX, NodeJS, and Docker setups for a server\n- Obtain the ssh keys for a server from the Key Management Database\n- Simple server management like starting, stopping, and restarting servers\n- very basic command line interface to manage the servers\n\n<center>\n![That's all folks](https://i.danielalas.com/01194d70)\n</center>",

In the second part, Hume shifts his focus from the abstract to the concrete and argues that, in actuality, no miracles that serve as the foundation for religious systems possess adequate evidence to meet the epistemological criteria laid out in Part I. To assess Hume's success in making a case against miracles, we must primarily consider Part I, the epistemology of miracles. In my view, Hume has convincingly made the argument against miracles while also not ruling out their potentiality, as is expected of a rational thinker.\n\nHume defines miracles as\n\n> “a violation of the laws of nature\" where the laws of nature are established from “firm and unalterable experience[s]” (Cahn, 127, Hume). He appears to believe that these “firm and unalterable experience[s]”\n> are established from one’s uniform experiences, that is a consistent set of experiences where nothing has been incorrectly predicted by previous experiences throughout life. Thus since Hume regards that “uniform experience amounts to proof,” we have a full proof for the laws of nature.\n\nThough what does Hume mean by proof? It is important here to explore this as what Hume is referring to as a proof is foundational to the success of his arguments and credibility as a rational actor. Yet given such importance, one would be amiss to find an equally clear definition in his text. However, Hume does distinguish between probability and proof. He defines proofs to be founded on “infallible experience” with which one can expect, with the “last degree of assurance” that their past experiences would constitute a predicted future event and probability to be founded on one’s best judgment of the available evidence. (Hume, 116)\n\nIn Earmans’ “_Hume's Abject Failure: The Argument Against Miracles_,” Earman believes that when Hume refers to proof as being an “infallible experience,” he’s regarding an unfalsifiable metaphysical claim, or in other words, a claim that can not be altered via any evidence. If this were the case, it would make Hume irrational as there would be no evidence that could convince one with such a conviction that they are incorrect. Or as Earman puts it, “[for Hume,] the probability of a miracle is [always] flatly zero. Very simple. And very crude.” (Earman, 23) This could be seen better with Bayesian inferencing, where the probability that a miracle occurred given the evidence is extrapolated as such.\n\nIn the case that Hume regarded probability that a miracle occurred to be 0, metaphysically impossible, no evidence could ever change the outcome, the belief. It would always be 0. And the same goes for if is 1, the probability of a miracle occurring is always true and thus, the outcome is also always 1, regardless of any and all evidence to the contrary.\n\n` `If we take Hume at this level of analysis, his metaphysical argument would boil down to “There must, therefore, be a uniform experience against every miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit that appellation. And as an uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full proof, from the nature of the fact, against the existence of any miracle[…]”(Cahn, 128, Hume). Essentially stating that since for there to be a miracle, there must definitionally be a uniform experience that amounts to proof against it, and since proofs are binary, miracles always have a probability of 0 and, thus, are never true. No evidence can convince him otherwise. Hume is irrational! But if we merit a better faith analysis, this would not be Hume's argument. He continues the previous statement with “nor can such a proof be destroyed, or the miracle rendered credible, but by an opposite proof, which is superior” (Cahn, 128, Hume). Thus Hume does not believe proofs against a miracle are conferred a binary probability. They can be “rendered credible” by another, better proof. Hume is rational! To disregard this point is to misinterpret Hume altogether, as I believe Earman has done.\n\nWith this in mind, we can venture into how Hume presumes one should analyze and compare competing proofs. In Part I, earlier than what is established by Cahn, Hume, an empiricist, explains how one may assume reasoning for such comparisons. Initially, he begins by stating the inherent fallibility of experiential reasoning, “Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us to errors.” In context with the earlier part of this text, It should be evident now that Hume certainly understands the proofs for the laws of nature are not infallible. He continues the above passage with the analogy, “One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken.” Thus even when the strongest experiential evidence, uniform experiences (a proof), ties a connection that has correctly predicted all events, Hume understands and argues here that there is no guarantee. P(M) and P(R) can never be 1 or 0.\n\nIt is still not clear when Hume compares proofs how he differentiates between that of one's own experiences and that of others. Though It appears most consistent with his arguments that when comparing, the experiences relevant to Hume are not limited to any singular experiential agent but must be that of all experiential agents. There are two primary reasons for this line of reasoning. First, it addresses the issues that arise when reasoning from one's own experience alone, specifically the significant limitation on the matters of fact that one can reason about. For instance, one cannot simply conclude, based on the regularity of their own experience, that a dead man never rises again because nobody has had enough personal experience of death. The second reason for appealing to collective experience arises in cases where an agent reasons, from their uniform experiences, of a consistent correlation of events, that another agent who has also had uniform experiences reasons a consistent uncorrelation of.\n\nHume's case of the Indian Prince appears to provide the best example of this form of reasoning from collective experience. Upon being informed of the effects frost has on water, freezing it, the Prince reasons from their uniform experience that water is always liquid under all circumstances to the conclusion that the informant must be lying. While the Prince is using reasoning, they arrive at an incorrect conclusion. As Hume points out, such an event [water freezing] may be considered extraordinary and require strong testimony to render it credible to people in a warm climate. However, this event is not miraculous nor contrary to uniform experiences in colder climates where all circumstances are the same. (Hume, 119) This highlights that Hume believes in the importance of considering the experiences of those in different circumstances when evaluating between claims.\n\nLastly, to assert that Hume rationally addresses all claims for miracles, we must discuss how Hume approaches the testimony of miracles. In Part I, he makes the following famous maxim:\n\n“[N]o testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish; and even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior.” (Cahn, 127, Hume)\n\nIn which for the testimony of a miracle to be credible Hume is essentially stating that the proof for it must be greater than the proof against it. Then in as so far as the “falsehood [of the testimony] would [have to] be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish,” if the proof for the miracle is already superior to that against it, this would be definitionally true. Essentially testimony is required to be about as perfect as can be to rival the proofs of natural law. A testimony of such stature, Hume asserts, can not be proved “so as to be the foundation of a system of religion” (Cahn, 129, Hume) but does not state that miracles are a priori impossible. When the two rival, we have proof against proof, and Hume states, \"[When] there is proof against proof, [..] the strongest must prevail, but still with a diminution of its force, in proportion to that of its antagonist.” (Cahn, 127, Hume)\n\nHume proceeds with a pragmatic example of someone witnessing the resurrection of a dead man. He evaluates the testimonial proof of the miracle against the experiential proof of the possibility of the witness being deceived and concludes that the greater miracle should be rejected. As we have seen with Hume's observations on the fallibility of our experiences, in most cases, the greater proof will be the fallibility of our experiences rather than the violation of natural law. In other words, the occurrence that does not align with our uniform experience is most often the greater miracle. Thus, Hume has effectively argued for the extreme improbability of a miracle testimony ever being true, but as a rational thinker, has not ruled out the possibility of a miracle ever occurring and its testimony being true.\n\nIn his work \"On Miracles,\" Paul Dietl raises an important challenge to Hume's proclivity against the credibility of miracles. Dietl notes that some events which meet the criteria for being considered a miracle may be inherently beyond our ability to analyze or experimentally reproduce. Specifically, Dietl argues that certain miracles may lack an independent variable, making them difficult to understand with scientific analysis. Dietl gives the example of a prophet tasked with performing a miracle under highly controlled conditions where no variable can be “pinned down as the independent variable in scientific explanation.” (Cahn, 132) If the prophet succeeds in accomplishing the miracle, we would be dealing solely with “requests and answers, that is, thoughts, and thoughts not as psychological occurrences but as understood [only from the prophet to a God]. No natural law will do because only vehicles of thought could function as the natural explanans, and no such vehicle is necessary.”\n\nFor Dietl's conclusion to hold, he would have to demonstrate that all future scientific inquiries would be categorically unable to provide any natural explanation for the observed phenomenon, not just our current understanding. This is a significant claim and one that Dietl has not successfully justified, as he provides no explanation for how we could rule out all future inquiries. If we encounter a miracle that defies our current scientific understanding and lacks any independent variable to pinpoint, we may still employ Hume's tools to compare the miracles. We could ask ourselves whether it is more miraculous that a God has broken some natural law or simply that we lack the tools of inquiry to analyze the situation.\n\nIn essence, Hume's conceptualization of miracles hinges upon the idea of a deviation from the laws of nature as they are established through firm and unalterable experience. Through this framework, he effectively differentiates between probability and proof, the latter of which he defines as being grounded in firm and unalterable experiences that can still be disproven. When the evidential proof for a miracle ever rivals that of natural law, then they must be subjected to a comparative analysis, and the one with greater justification ought to be embraced. However, Hume remains cognizant of the fact that experiences are fallible and that testimony, if of adequate stature, can contest natural laws as proof. In sum, while Hume's perspective successfully discredits the arguments against miracles, his position as a rational thinker precludes him from outrightly disproving their possibility.\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nCahn, Steven M. _Exploring Philosophy of Religion: An Introductory Anthology_.

He continues the above passage with the analogy, \\u201COne, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken.\\u201D Thus even when the strongest experiential evidence, uniform experiences (a proof), ties a connection that has correctly predicted all events, Hume understands and argues here that there is no guarantee.

There are two primary reasons for this line of reasoning. First, it addresses the issues that arise when reasoning from one's own experience alone, specifically the significant limitation on the matters of fact that one can reason about. For instance, one cannot simply conclude, based on the regularity of their own experience, that a dead man never rises again because nobody has had enough personal experience of death. The second reason for appealing to collective experience arises in cases where an agent reasons, from their uniform experiences, of a consistent correlation of events, that another agent who has also had uniform experiences reasons a consistent uncorrelation of.\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"C:\\\\dev\\\\projects\\\\my-site\\\\posts\\\\_mdx_bundler_entry_point-69902a9c-a6db-47d3-b14d-87e57ee97a13.mdx\",lineNumber:29,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,i.jsxDEV)(n.p,{children:\"Hume's case of the Indian Prince appears to provide the best example of this form of reasoning from collective experience.

While the Prince is using reasoning, they arrive at an incorrect conclusion. As Hume points out, such an event [water freezing] may be considered extraordinary and require strong testimony to render it credible to people in a warm climate.

In other words, the occurrence that does not align with our uniform experience is most often the greater miracle.

If we encounter a miracle that defies our current scientific understanding and lacks any independent variable to pinpoint, we may still employ Hume's tools to compare the miracles.

When the evidential proof for a miracle ever rivals that of natural law, then they must be subjected to a comparative analysis, and the one with greater justification ought to be embraced. However, Hume remains cognizant of the fact that experiences are fallible and that testimony, if of adequate stature, can contest natural laws as proof.
