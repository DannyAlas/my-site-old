# Understanding the Role of Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine and Glutamate in Behavior

The ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a crucial role in various behaviors through the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA) and glutamate (GLU). Recent advances in neuroscience highlight the complexity of neurotransmitter release in the VTA, particularly focusing on neurons that co-release GLU and DA. The function of DA release from these neurons remains a subject of intrigue in the scientific community.

## Research Objectives and Methods

Our research aims to dissect how GLU and DA co-release from VTA neurons influences behavior, and how it differs from the release of GLU or DA alone. The methodology involves:

1. **Knockdown of DA in VTA GLU-DA Releasing Neurons**: This process is executed by injecting a Cre-dependent siRNA (shRNA) AAV vector in VGLUT2:Cre mice.

2. **Behavioral Impact Observation in Reward and Fear Conditioning Tasks**: Mice undergo Pavlovian Reward and Fear conditioning paradigms where a conditioned stimulus (CS+) is paired with either a reward (sucrose) or a shock (fear), and a different stimulus (CS-) is paired with no outcome.

## Knockdown Results

We achieved successful knockdown of DA in VTA GLU-DA neurons, confirmed through various imaging techniques:
- **VTA Imaging**: Comparative analysis using immunohistochemistry (IHC) between control and knockdown vectors.
- **Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) Imaging**: Analysis through in situ hybridization (ISH), focusing on the NAc shell, a major projection target of the VTA.
- **Statistical Analysis**: We observed a significant reduction in TH protein in the ROI, indicating successful DA knockdown.

## Behavioral Results

The knockdown mice displayed a notable impairment in performance in both reward and shock conditioning tasks:

- **Reward Port Entry**: A decrease in the frequency of entering the reward port during CS+ cues in knockdown mice.
- **Time Spent Frozen**: An increase in the duration of freezing during fear cues.
- **Discrimination Ratio Analysis**: Knockdown mice showed a lower ability to discriminate between CS+ and CS- cues, indicating impaired learning ability.

## Conclusions and Discussion

The data indicates that conditional knockdown of DA from GLU-DA VTA neurons leads to learning deficits in both reward and fear conditioning tasks. This suggests that DA release from these neurons is critical for fear learning and reward association, which is distinct from the role of DA-only release from the VTA.

## Current and Next Steps

- **Current**: We are conducting fiber photometry analysis and optogenetic activation/inactivation of VTA subpopulations during behavioral tasks to further understand activation patterns.
- **Next**: We plan to explore the effects of conditional DA recovery from GLU-DA VTA neurons.
